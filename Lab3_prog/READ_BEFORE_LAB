This UML diagram got accepted, but it is a bit different from final result,
so, because I have literally zero time to change it, do not rely on it this much.
It has a very cool logic, that is the most important thing. But overall,
there is a lot of changes in methods and other stuff in /src directory.

Go check it yourself now!)
